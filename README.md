# Incentivize

Our project, Incentivize, serves as a bridge between generous donors and dedicated domain experts in the domain of philanthropy. Through this initiative, individuals are encouraged to donate to charitable causes and relief campaigns in exchange for the valuable time and expertise of specialists in various fields.

While our current initiative is exclusively dedicated to supporting Sandeep Nailwal's Indian Covid Crypto Relief campaign, we envision expanding our platform to accommodate any verified fund or charitable organization, allowing them to enlist for charitable donations.
